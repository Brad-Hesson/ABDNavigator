# ABDNavigator Help

## Startup
Before starting, ensure that a directory has been setup where the data will be stored which contains a navigation file.  A default navigation file can be copied from the ABDNavigator folder: [default_deviceNavigation.xml](default_deviceNavigation.xml).

When you first start ABDNavigator (using [run.bat](run.bat)) from the command line, a "file open" dialog is displayed. Find the data directory you setup and choose the navigation xml (e.g. *default_deviceNavigation.xml*) file. 

## Some First Steps
There is currently no menu system implemented, so all functionality is achieved through **hot-keys** (detailed in the next section) and operations exposed by the **Attribute Editor**.  As an introduction, here are some first steps to try:

### 1. Toggle the **Tree View** 
Press: **Ctrl** + **T**

### 2. Toggle the **Attribute Editor**
Press: **Ctrl** + **A**

### 3. Create a **PathLayer**
Select *NavigationLayer* in the **Tree View**.  Then Press: **Ctrl** + **=**
