# ABDNavigator Help

## Startup
Before starting, ensure that a directory has been setup where the data will be stored which contains a navigation file.  A default navigation file can be copied from the ABDNavigator folder: [default_deviceNavigation.xml](default_deviceNavigation.xml).
When you first start ABDNavigator (using [run.bat](run.bat)) from the command line, a "file open" dialog is displayed.
