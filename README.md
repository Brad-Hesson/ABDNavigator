# Project Name: ABDNavigator

## Project Description:
Scanning probe control and sample navigation for atom-based devices.

## Project Components:
**ABDNavigator** is the navigation interface and is the primary interface seen by the end-user.  It is meant to be user friendly with a google-maps-like interface in which elements of the "map" such as images and labels are editable.

**ABDController** is designed to communicate with a scanned probe controller, providing a means for the ABDNavigator to communicate with a scanning probe.  Currently an interface to the ScientaOmicron Matrix controller is implemented, though by design ABDController can be extended in a modular fashion to implement communication with other scanning probe controllers that provide sufficient APIs.
