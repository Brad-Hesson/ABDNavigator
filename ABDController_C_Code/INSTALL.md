# Installation of ABDController_C_Code

The **ABDController_C_Code** is the C code that directly interfaces with the Matrix *RemoteAccess_API*.  This C code communicates with the **ABDContoller** java code via the Java Native Interface (jni).  

This document details:
1. Setup of the Visual Studio Community IDE[ยน] to allow modification of *com_MatrixInteface.dll* (the dynamic link library that calls functions in the *Matrix RemoteAccess_API*)
1. The use of jni to generate *com_MatrixInterface.h* (the C header file that defines communication between Java and C).

## 1. Set up the IDE
First, if needed, install Visual Studio Community (a free IDE that enables generation of a Windows10 compliant dll), which can be found at: 
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/

When choosing what components to install, make sure to enable "Desktop development with C++" - this should provide everything necessary to work with the "solution" file: [ABDController_C_Code/vc/com_MatrixInterface/com_MatrixInterface.sln](vc/com_MatrixInterface/com_MatrixInterface.sln).

Next open [ABDController_C_Code/vc/com_MatrixInterface/com_MatrixInterface.sln](vc/com_MatrixInterface/com_MatrixInterface.sln) in the Visual Studio IDE.

### 1a. Ensure that the Solution configuration is "Release" and the Solution platform is "x64":
