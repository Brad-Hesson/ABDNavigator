# Installation of ABDController_C_Code

The **ABDController_C_Code** is the C code that directly interfaces with the Matrix *RemoteAccess_API*.  This C code communicates with the **ABDContoller** java code via the Java Native Interface (jni).  

This document details setup of the Visual Studio Community IDE[ยน] to allow modification of *com_MatrixInteface.dll* (the dynamic link library that calls functions in the *Matrix RemoteAccess_API*), as well as the use of jni to generate *com_MatrixInterface.h* (the C header file that defines communication between Java and C).

## 1. Set up the IDE
