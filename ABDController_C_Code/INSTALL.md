# Installation of ABDController_C_Code

The **ABDController_C_Code** is the C code that directly interfaces with the Matrix *RemoteAccess_API*.  This C code communicates with the **ABDContoller** java code via the Java Native Interface (jni).  

This document details:
1. Setup of the Visual Studio Community IDE[ยน] to allow modification of *com_MatrixInteface.dll* (the dynamic link library that calls functions in the *Matrix RemoteAccess_API*)
1. The use of jni to generate *com_MatrixInterface.h* (the C header file that defines communication between Java and C).

## 1. Set up the IDE
First, if needed, install Visual Studio Community (a free IDE that enables generation of a Windows10 compliant dll), which can be found at: 
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/

When choosing what components to install, make sure to enable "Desktop development with C++" - this should provide everything necessary to work with the "solution" file: [ABDController_C_Code/vc/com_MatrixInterface/com_MatrixInterface.sln](vc/com_MatrixInterface/com_MatrixInterface.sln).

Next open [ABDController_C_Code/vc/com_MatrixInterface/com_MatrixInterface.sln](vc/com_MatrixInterface/com_MatrixInterface.sln) in the Visual Studio IDE.

### 1a. Ensure that the Solution configuration is "Release" and the Solution platform is "x64":
![64 bit Release](../images/vs1.PNG)

### 1b. Open the project properties window:
![Project Properties](../images/vs2.PNG)

### 1c. Under Configuration Properties > General, ensure that the Configuration Type is "dll" and that the Windows SDK Version is "10.0 (latest installed version)":
![dll and SDK](../images/vs3.PNG)

### 1d. Under C/C++ > General, ensure that "Additional Include Directories" is pointing to the include and include\win32 folders of your installed JDK 8, and to the RemoteAccess directory of the Matrix SDK:
![include](../images/vs4.PNG)

### 1e. Under Linker > General, ensure that "Additional Library Directories" is pointing to the  RemoteAccess directory of the Matrix SDK:
![linker](../images/vs5.PNG)

### 1f. Under Linker > Input, ensure that "Additional Dependencies" is pointing to the  RemoteAccess library file: *RemoteAccess_lib*:
![lib](../images/vs6.PNG)

### 1g. The IDE should now be properly setup.
This can be verified by "building" the solution:
![build](../images/vs7.PNG)

This should generate the dll file: **ABDController_C_Code\vc\com_MatrixInterface\x64\Release\com_MatrixInterface.dll** which can then be copied into the [ABDController](../ABDController) folder.

## 2. Re-generate com_MatrixInterface.h:
If changes have been made to the java code for ABDController/com/MatrixInterface.java, then com_MatrixInterface.h needs to be regenerated and placed in appropriate folders.  This can be done by re-running the install.bat file:

Using the windows command line (cmd), navigate to the [ABDController](../ABDController) folder, and execute [install.bat](install.bat):

```cmd
C:\Users\foo\git\ABDNavigator-master>cd ABDController
C:\Users\foo\git\ABDNavigator-master\ABDController>install.bat
```
